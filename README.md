# r-port-doctor

r-port-doctor is a command-line tool for Windows that provides detailed information about network connections, similar to `netstat`. It allows you to filter, sort, and display information about TCP and UDP sockets, including the process ID (PID), process name, local and remote addresses, and connection state.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Detailed Socket Information:** Get a comprehensive view of TCP and UDP sockets on your system.
- **Filtering:** Filter connections by port, process name, PID, protocol, address and connection state.
- **Sorting:** Sort the output by various fields, including PID, port, process name, address and uptime.
- **JSON Output:** Output the results in JSON format for easy parsing and integration with other tools.
- **Hostname Resolution:** Resolve remote IP addresses to hostnames.
- **Uptime Information:** View the uptime of each connection in different formats.
- **Statistics:** Get a summary of connection statistics, including total connections, TCP/UDP counts, and more.
